  "title": "Further PfP: Pain-free Passwords development",
  "par1": "Contrary to the previous announcement, PfP: Pain-free Passwords will be developed further after all. However, PfP 3.x is essentially a new extension now and wonâ€™t be served as an update to this legacy extension.",
  "par2": "Most important change: PfP 3.x reads and writes KeePass databases, so that it can be used in parallel to KeePass, KeePassXC and other applications. However, it now relies on an external application (PfP Native Host) being installed and configured.",
  "par3": "You can try out PfP 3.x without removing this PfP version. PfP 3.x can import backup files from PfP 2.x, making migration easy.",
  "par4": "Or you can just continue using legacy PfP. While it is no longer being developed, it should continue working as before.",
