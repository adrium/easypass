Easy Passwords
==============

Easy Passwords is a Firefox extension that allows generating secure site-specific passwords for all websites from a single master password. It keeps track of the parameters used to generate these passwords, but the passwords themselves are never stored. You can always generate them again if you have the master password, but without the master password the data stored by this extension is useless.

Legacy passwords that you cannot change can also be stored securely in this extension, these will be encrypted using your master password and cannot be decrypted without knowing the master password.
